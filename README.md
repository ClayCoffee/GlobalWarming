# GlobalWarming (WIP)
This Slimefun addon adds climate change mechanics to the game.

## Planned mechanics
- Per world temperature rising: When using generators and such the temperature in the world will rise because of the CO2 pollution. Each biome has a unique default temperature. When the temperature rises in a world, the biome temperatures will rise equally. (For example: Icy biomes has -5°C and deserts has 30°C. When the temp. rising is +10°C, the temp. will be 5°C in icy biomes and 40°C in deserts)

- Forest fires
- Ice melting
- Slowness in extreme temperatures
- Thirstiness in hot temperatures (like 40°C or so in the desert)

## Items
- Thermometer: A placeable block which indicates the current temperature in that biome. (You can change the temperature scale with a right click. Available types: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
