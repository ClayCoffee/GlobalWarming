# GlobalWarming (WIP)
This Slimefun addon adds climate change mechanics to the game.

## Planned mechanics
- Per world temperature rising: When using generators and such the temperature in the world will rise because of the air pollution. Each biome has a unique default temperature. When the temperature rises in a world, the biome temperatures will rise equally. (For example: Icy biomes has -5°C and deserts has 30°C. When the temp. rising is +10°C, the temp. will be 5°C in icy biomes and 40°C in deserts)
- At night, the temperature will drop 10°C by default
- When it's raining, the temperature will drop 5°C by default
- Forest fires (near to players)
- Ice melting (near to players)
- Slowness in extreme temperatures*
- Thirstiness in hot temperatures* (like 40°C or so in the desert/nether)
- Burning in very hot temperatures*
- And config options to configure default biome temperatures & enable/disable these mechanics
- Maybe some integration with EcoPower addon?

\* There will be also a config option to enable these mechanics only for players, who have a specific research. (For example the knowledge of Energy regulator.)

## Items
- Thermometer: A placeable block which indicates the current temperature in that biome. (You can change the temperature scale with a right click. Available types: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
